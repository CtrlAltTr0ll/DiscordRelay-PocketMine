DiscordRelay Plugin
===============
_Allows you to relay messages between a PocketMine server and Discord!_

### About

DiscordRelay is a [PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP) plugin that provides easy-to-configure functionality so you can bridge your Minecraft server and Discord guild chats. You can easily make a one way bridge from discord to your server, from your server to discord or both ways; you can even setup a channel for your servers console output to be relayed to! All of this is done by editing the [Settings]() file that is automatically generated by the plugin when it is first installed, by default DiscordRelay will not work as you need to provide your own bot token and setup the channels.
