### About

DiscordRelay is a [PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP) plugin that provides easy-to-configure
functionality so you can bridge your Minecraft server and Discord guild chats. You can easily make a one way bridge
from discord to your server, from your server to discord or both ways; you can even setup multiple channels at varying
log levels to be relayed to! All of this is done by editing the [Settings](https://github.com/JackNoordhuis/DiscordRelay-PocketMine/blob/master/resources/Settings.yml)
file that is automatically generated by the plugin when it is first installed, by default DiscordRelay will not work as
you need to provide your own bot token and setup the channels.

### Download

Discord Relay is currently in the ALPHA stage of releases so some things may not work as expected and there is no
guarantee the plugin won't suddenly stop working. If you would like to try out the plugin head over [to the releases](https://github.com/JackNoordhuis/DiscordRelay-PocketMine/releases)
and grab the latest version compatible with your PocketMine server.
